## Project Overview

This mini-project demonstrates an **end-to-end AI/ML workflow integrated with Snowflake**, showcasing:

- Data ingestion into Snowflake using **Mockaroo-generated synthetic data**
- Exploratory analysis using **Snowflake SQL**
- Machine Learning model training using **Snowpark for Python**
- Model evaluation and prediction storage back into Snowflake  
- Visualization of key insights and churn behavior

Built as part of an AI/ML Engineer assignment focusing on **Snowflake Operations and ML Integration**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Category | Tools & Frameworks |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Cloud & Data** | Snowflake ❄️ (POC_DB, Snowpark, SQL Worksheets) |
| **Programming** | Python 3.12, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Joblib |
| **ML Pipeline** | Logistic Regression (Churn Prediction) |
| **Integration** | Snowpark for Python, Snowflake Connector |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Snowflake Charts |
| **Data Source** | Mockaroo (1000 synthetic telecom customer records) |

---

## Problem Statement

> **Goal:** Predict which customers are likely to churn (i.e., discontinue their service) based on historical usage and demographic factors.

**Dataset Features:**
- `age`, `tenure_months`, `monthly_charges`, `total_charges`  
- `gender`, `contract_type`, `payment_method`, `internet_service`, `num_support_calls`  
- Target variable: `churn`

## Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Generation & Ingestion
- Dataset of **1000 rows** created using [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/)
- Uploaded as `CUSTOMER_CHURN` table to:
  - **Database:** `POC_DB`
  - **Schema:** `PUBLIC`
  - **Warehouse:** `POC_WH`

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CUSTOMER_CHURN;
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_CHURN LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory SQL Analysis
Performed inside Snowflake Worksheets.

#### 📈 Average Charges
```sql
SELECT AVG(monthly_charges), AVG(total_charges) FROM CUSTOMER_CHURN;
```
**Output:**  
Monthly Avg = 55.06 | Total Avg = 2012.87

---

#### Churn by Contract Type
```sql
SELECT contract_type, AVG(churn) AS churn_rate, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM CUSTOMER_CHURN
GROUP BY contract_type
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;
```

**Insight:**  
Customers with **Month-to-Month contracts** have the highest churn rate (~72%).

#### Churn by Support Calls
```sql
SELECT num_support_calls, AVG(churn) AS churn_rate
FROM CUSTOMER_CHURN
GROUP BY num_support_calls
ORDER BY num_support_calls;
```

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning with Snowpark (Python)
Model training and prediction executed in VS Code via Snowpark session.

#### **Model Details**
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression  
- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20  
- **ROC AUC:** 1.00  
- **Accuracy:** 100% (on synthetic balanced data)

#### Core Script
File: `snowflake_churn_ml.py`

```python
# Train Model
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=300)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
y_prob = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, y_prob))
```

**Output:**
```
ROC AUC: 1.0  
End-to-end POC completed successfully.
```

### 4️⃣ Writing Predictions to Snowflake
Predictions were uploaded to a new table:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE CHURN_PREDICTIONS (
  CHURN_ACTUAL INT,
  CHURN_PRED INT,
  CHURN_PROB FLOAT
);
```

Sample Output:
